            I am a first-year Software Enginnering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
            At RIT, I am a member of the Honors Program, Performing Arts Scholars, and play in the RIT Pep Band. 
            I graduated from the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities in 2021. 
            In my free time, I like to make music, follow sports, and work on personal software projects.
